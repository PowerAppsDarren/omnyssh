//! Auto SSH key-setup command (tech-gui.md §4.2). `start_key_setup` mirrors the TUI's
//! orchestration (crates/omnyssh `ConfirmKeySetup`): connect a password session, drive
//! `setup_key_for_host_detailed`, and report progress + the terminal outcome as
//! `CoreEvent::KeySetup*` on the shared engine channel — the bridge maps those to
//! `key-setup-*` IPC events (§3.4). Once the key works it writes it back onto the
//! manual host in `hosts.toml`, the same completion write the TUI performs, so a
//! `reload_hosts` afterwards refreshes `hasKey`/`passwordAuthDisabled` on the card. A
//! failure that may have left password login off saves the tested key alone.
